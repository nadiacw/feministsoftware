# feminist software art workshop/hack

[+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+SIGN UP+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+](https://)

## what?
A speculative art and design workshop for making sense of the current software and digital tools and imagining feminist software of the future. co-create art that represents these ideas.

## how?
1. We will discuss the feminist values (intersectionality, environmental care, data privacy, reproductive rights, ...) that software could embody.
2. Through different brain/body-storming activities we will prototype and create scenarios in which this software might be used, imagining different (maybe desired, maybe undesired) futures.
3. The scenarios will be enacted and presented through a prototype, a sketch, a painting, a performance, a poem, any material/tangible form.

The final contributions will be documented by participants and exhibited on a public website or in a public event in the future.

## when / where?
Sometime in late March or early April 2020 at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

_“The internet holds huge potential for liberation and political transformation. However many of society’s inequalities are encoded in its structures, processes and communities.

_“how might we design for difference and how may I, as a scholar and artist, take code seriously and consider values, ethics and diversity in designing a tech-related workshop?”_ [A Report on the Feminist Coding Workshop in p5.js – Aesthetic Programming](http://aestheticprogramming.siusoon.net/articles/a-report-on-the-feminist-coding-workshop-in-p5-js/)
